# DSA-IntrnForte

Have included 6 tricky questions that are asked in interviews which tests how strong you are on your fundamentals of DSA.

Remember that DSA doesnt mea we use arrays/stacks/linked lists, it also includes how you look at the data and how you operate with them.


The repo also includes an index to blogs with coding questions that are important and
hence advised to go through them and solve as many as possible.
